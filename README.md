# To get the results of the GENEPARK project:
# Download all code and data files into the same directory
# Open reproduce_geneparks_results.R 
# Set the working dir to the directory in which all files are in
# Run the analyses to get the models, signature, and figures. Note that some analyses are slow (especially the fSVA-based).
